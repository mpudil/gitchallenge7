#+TITLE: No Conflict Case

** The new option 'configure --with-mailutils' causes Emacs to rely on
GNU Mailutils to retrieve email.  It is recommended, and is the
default if GNU Mailutils is installed.  When --with-mailutils is not
in effect, the Emacs build procedure by default continues to build and
install a limited 'movemail' substitute that retrieves POP3 email only
via insecure channels; to avoid this problem, use either
--with-mailutils or --without-pop when configuring.

** The new option 'configure --enable-gcc-warnings=warn-only' causes
GCC to issue warnings without stopping the build.  This behavior is
now the default in developer builds.  As before, use
'--enable-gcc-warnings' to stop the build if GCC issues warnings. WHAT THE HECK DOES THAT MEAN????

This is the line of text that I am adding to the file. Creative, isn't it?
